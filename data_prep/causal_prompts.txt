##for TP candidate generation

Please generate 20 samples in jsonl format for pairwise semantic relevance reranking task. Each sample must follow the content requirements and format requirements below.

**Content requirements:**
(1) The query should be a "wh"-question and keywords in the questions must have synonyms.
(2) **Passage A** must always be semantically relevant to the query. Passage B must always be semantically irrelevant to the query.
(3) **Passage A** and the query must share at least one overlapping non-stopword keyword. Passage B must not contain any overlapping token with the query.
(4) **Passage A** and Passage B should be about similar or related topics, so that the pair forms a hard example (difficult to judge at first glance, but with a unique correct answer).

**Format requirements:**
(1)Output must be in jsonl format.
(2)Each entry must include: qid, query, passage_A, passage_B, and output.
(3)Each qid and pid must be unique and assigned in order.
(4)Always set "output": "Passage A".

Now, please directly generate 20 new jsonl samples that strictly follow the above rules. Please follow the format here and start from qid 000021 and pid000041. {"qid": "000020", "query": "...", "passage_A": {"pid": "0000039", "passage": "..."}, "passage_B": {"pid": "0000040", "passage": "..."}, "output": "Passage A"}

### for TP perturbation:
Please perturb each of the following triples (original examples) used for pairwise semantic relevance reranking. These examples all satisfy the following conditions:
(1) "gold_output" Passage is always semantically relevant to the query. the other passage is always semantically irrelevant to the query.
(2) the **relevant passage** and the query share at least one overlapping non-stopword token. 

**Perturbation requirements:**
(1) Replace ALL OVERLAPPING TOKENS in the **Relevant Passage** that also appears in the query (i.e., all overlapping tokens) with suitable synonyms, while keeping the overall sentence semantics unchanged.
(2) Do not modify any other part of relevant passage except the overlapping tokens, and make sure all overlapping tokens are replaced. Do not modify irrelevant passage.
(3) The output must be in JSONL format, consistent with the structure of the original examples.

Following the above instructions, please perturb those original examples provided below and return the results in JSONL format.
