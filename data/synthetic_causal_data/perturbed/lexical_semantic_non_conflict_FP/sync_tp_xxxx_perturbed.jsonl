{"qid": "000233", "query": "Why do economists track inflation when analyzing purchasing power?", "passage_A": {"pid": "0000467", "passage": "Economic analysts monitor price growth because rising prices erode buying power. Indices such as CPI and PCE measure changes in consumer baskets, enabling adjustments to wages, interest rates, and real income comparisons across time."}, "passage_B": {"pid": "0000468", "passage": "Museum archival rooms list humidity targets, acid-free storage boxes, catalog accession codes, gloves policy notes, and rotating exhibit calendars."}, "output": "Passage A"}
{"qid": "000234", "query": "What mechanisms cause earthquakes along transform faults?", "passage_A": {"pid": "0000469", "passage": "Seismic events along strike-slip fault zones arise from shear stress accumulation and sudden slip. Locked segments store elastic strain; when frictional resistance fails, rupture propagates and releases seismic waves along the fault zone."}, "passage_B": {"pid": "0000470", "passage": "Subway art programs commission murals, tile mosaics, platform poetry plaques, and station wayfinding posters through municipal grants and design juries."}, "output": "Passage A"}
{"qid": "000236", "query": "How do enzymes accelerate biochemical reactions in cells?", "passage_A": {"pid": "0000473", "passage": "Biocatalysts speed up chemical processes by lowering activation energy through substrate binding and transition state stabilization. Active sites provide precise orientation, acid-base catalysis, and induced fit, increasing reaction rates without altering equilibrium."}, "passage_B": {"pid": "0000474", "passage": "Sailing regatta briefings include buoy layouts, protest committee forms, wind window forecasts, skipper roll calls, and horn signal timing sheets."}, "output": "Passage A"}
{"qid": "000238", "query": "Why can high altitude lead to shortness of breath during exercise?", "passage_A": {"pid": "0000477", "passage": "Great elevation reduces ambient oxygen pressure, lowering arterial saturation and limiting aerobic metabolism. During physical exertion, ventilation and heart rate increase to compensate, yet oxygen delivery remains constrained, causing dyspnea."}, "passage_B": {"pid": "0000478", "passage": "Mountaineering film crews discuss drone waiver paperwork, lens condensation fixes, battery insulation tricks, and pack weight spreadsheets for glacier shoots."}, "output": "Passage A"}
